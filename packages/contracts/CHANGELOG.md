# @clearideas/agent-runtime-contracts

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a9b18c: Add host-defined workspaces and the run sandbox. A manifest binds a workspace
  (a code base, document store, or scratch area declared in the `workspaces`
  configuration section) by reference and may only narrow its mode and tools.
  Every model operation on a workspace executes as one command inside an
  isolated per-run sandbox declared by the new `sandbox` configuration section:
  built-in `list_files`, `read_file`, `search_files`, `write_file`, and
  `delete_file` operations served by a bundled helper, host-allowlisted
  `commands`, and an opt-in `shell`. Commands are admitted by the host policy,
  vetoable through `authorizeCommand`, reported through `workspace.bound` and
  `sandbox.*` events, recorded as `SandboxCommandRecord` in the transcript, and
  budgeted per run. Read-write mounts sync back through `WorkspaceStore` after
  each command; the agent process never interprets workspace content. Code steps
  may execute in the run sandbox with `workspaces` or `sandbox: run`. The sandbox
  package gains `ProviderRunSandbox`, the command policy engine,
  `BubblewrapSandboxProvider` (Linux isolation without a container daemon),
  Docker read-only attachments, labels, and tmpfs sizing, and a test-only
  `HostProcessTestProvider` under `./testing`. Inline worker configuration
  cannot define workspaces or a sandbox.

### Patch Changes

- ec1209b: Require patched MCP SDK and Zod releases for configured MCP connections and
  manifest/configuration validation. Refresh vulnerable transitive dependencies
  without changing runtime APIs, manifest formats, or checkpoint contracts.
